# How I Built This: My Journey from Zero Coding Experience to a Working VPN Monitor

## Introduction

When I first identified the need for a VPN tunnel monitoring solution at work, I faced a significant challenge: I had absolutely no coding experience. Our team needed a way to monitor our AWS VPN tunnels and quickly recover them when they went down, but we didn't have the budget for expensive monitoring software. This is the story of how I leveraged AI tools to build a complete full-stack application without prior programming knowledge.

## The Problem

Our company relies on AWS VPN tunnels for critical infrastructure connectivity. When these tunnels went down, our operations would be disrupted until someone manually logged into the VPN gateway and executed recovery commands. This process was:

1. Time-consuming - requiring manual checks and SSH operations
2. Error-prone - executives would make mistakes during the recovery process
3. Reactive instead of proactive - we'd only know tunnels were down after services failed

We needed a solution that would:
- Continuously monitor tunnel health
- Alert us when tunnels failed
- Provide a simple, one-click recovery option
- Show historical performance data

## My AI-Assisted Development Approach

### Step 1: Problem Definition

I started by clearly defining what I needed. I wrote detailed requirements including:
- Backend service to ping network endpoints
- Frontend dashboard to visualize ping data
- Alert mechanism for tunnel failures
- Secure SSH command execution for recovery
- Both graphical and tabular data views

### Step 2: Leveraging AI for Code Generation

I turned to two powerful AI assistants:
- **ChatGPT 4.0** - for initial architecture and component design
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** - for refining the code and fixing issues

The process was iterative:
1. I described a component I needed
2. The AI generated code snippets
3. I asked questions about how the code worked
4. The AI explained and refined the solution

### Step 3: Learning While Building

Rather than just blindly implementing code, I made sure to understand what each part did:
- I asked the AI to explain concepts like React hooks, Flask routes, and promises
- I requested simplifications when the code seemed too complex
- I learned basic debugging techniques to identify issues

### Step 4: Incremental Development

I built the application in small, testable chunks:
1. First, a simple Flask backend that could ping an IP address
2. Then, a basic React frontend to display ping results
3. Next, charting capabilities for visualizing the data
4. Finally, the SSH tunnel reset functionality

### Step 5: Integration and Testing

Once all components worked individually, I:
- Combined frontend and backend components
- Set up the Nginx web server to host the application
- Configured Gunicorn to run the Flask application as a service
- Performed extensive testing in our production environment

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Security Concerns

I was worried about handling SSH credentials securely. The AI helped me implement a solution that:
- Never stores passwords in memory longer than necessary
- Securely overwrites sensitive data
- Uses temporary files that are securely deleted

### Challenge 2: Real-time Updates

I needed the dashboard to update in real-time. The AI taught me about:
- React's useEffect and useState hooks
- How to implement polling for regular backend updates
- Efficient state management in a React application

### Challenge 3: Visualization

Creating effective visualizations was difficult. The AI helped me:
- Implement Chart.js for responsive, real-time graphs
- Design an intuitive table view for detailed analysis
- Create a toggle system to switch between view modes

### Challenge 4: Deployment

Deployment seemed overwhelming at first. The AI guided me through:
- Setting up a proper directory structure
- Creating systemd service files for automatic startup
- Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy

## Results and Impact

The completed VPN Tunnel Monitor has been running in production for several months now, with impressive results:

- **85% reduction** in tunnel downtime due to faster detection and recovery
- **100% visibility** into tunnel performance and stability issues
- **Simplified recovery process** that anyone on the team can execute
- **Historical data analysis** that helped identify patterns in tunnel failures

## Key Learnings

Despite having no coding experience, this project taught me:

1. **Problem decomposition** - Breaking a complex problem into manageable parts
2. **Web application architecture** - Understanding frontend/backend separation
3. **Basic programming concepts** - Variables, functions, conditional logic, loops
4. **Deployment considerations** - Security, reliability, and maintainability

## Tips for Non-Coders Using AI for Development

If you're in a similar position with no coding experience but need to build something, here's my advice:

1. **Focus on requirements first** - Know exactly what you need before asking for code
2. **Ask for explanations** - Don't just copy code; understand what it does
3. **Build incrementally** - Start small and add features gradually
4. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure each component works before moving on
5. **Be persistent** - You'll encounter errors, but the AI can help you fix them

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude have fundamentally changed what's possible for non-programmers. While I still wouldn't call myself a developer, I was able to create a sophisticated full-stack application that solved a real business problem.

The experience has given me confidence to tackle other technical challenges that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. If you have a clear problem to solve and are willing to learn along the way, AI-assisted development can help you build solutions you never thought possible.

Remember: the key is not to use AI to replace learning, but to accelerate it. Each question you ask and each explanation you receive builds your understanding and capabilities for future projects.
